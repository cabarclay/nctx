telegram bot what send messages what have been forwarded to it what
for enjoyment

for use: TELOXIDE_TOKEN (https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) and
DATABASE_URL (https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx, pointing to an
sqlite3 database) must be set

schema or migragtion or fitever it's called what for setting up the
database is provided in `schema` 

this program is provided as is in whatever state you see it without
any promise of it ever working - in the past or future. tissues, 
however, are not provided so reading the source isn't recommended :)
it's probably quite hacky.
